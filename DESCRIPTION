Description: This package provides several methods for calculating uncertainty
    intervals (confidence intervals, credible intervals) for the incremental
    cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is the ratio of incremental costs
    to incremental effects. It includes the bootstrap percentile method,
    Fieller method and bootstrap acceptability method.
